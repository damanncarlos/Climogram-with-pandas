# Climogram-with-pandas
This is a python script to build climograms using pandas and matplotlib 

The object of this script is to be able to build climograms automatically by adding the neccesary data. Climograms are graphs representing precipitation and temperature in some timeframe (usually more than 30 years). Using pandas and matplotlib, the scripts returns the graph and a new dataframe with the historic average of each month. 
The data require is the max and min temperatures and precipitation levels. 

I'm new at coding and this is one of my first scripts, the matplotlib graph is really simple and will be getting more advanced while I keep learning how to do it, this also apply for the code in general.
